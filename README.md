# PFA 11A - VisuAlgo 

- Requirements.txt is the requirements to run the project
- Requirements_dev.txt is the requirements to run the tests

To start the project:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
This will install the requirements.

For testing however It will be with CI but you can do it locally with:
```bash
pip install -r ./requirements_dev.txt
```
All of that can be done by executing the script:
```
./script.sh
```
